This creates an opportunity for attackers to pose as a trusted\nentity and intercept, manipulate, or steal the data being transmitted.</p>\n<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>\n<p>Establishing trust in a secure way is a non-trivial task. When you disable certificate validation, you are removing a key mechanism designed to\nbuild this trust in internet communication, opening your system up to a number of potential threats.</p>\n<h4>Identity spoofing</h4>\n<p>If a system does not validate certificates, it cannot confirm the identity of the other party involved in the communication. An attacker can\nexploit this by creating a fake server and masquerading as a legitimate one. For example, they might set up a server that looks like your bank’s\nserver, tricking your system into thinking it is communicating with the bank. This scenario, called identity spoofing, allows the attacker to collect\nany data your system sends to them, potentially leading to significant data breaches.</p>\n<h4>Loss of data integrity</h4>\n<p>When TLS certificate validation is disabled, the integrity of the data you send and receive cannot be guaranteed. An attacker could modify the data\nin transit, and you would have no way of knowing. This could range from subtle manipulations of the data you receive to the injection of malicious\ncode or malware into your system. The consequences of such breaches of data integrity can be severe, depending on the nature of the data and the\nsystem.</p>\n<h2>How to fix it</h2>\n<h3>Code examples</h3>\n<p>The following code contains examples of disabled certificate validation.</p>\n<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"1\" data-diff-type=\"noncompliant\">\nname: Example\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n\njobs:\n  main:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: example\n        # Sensitive\n        run: curl --insecure -O https://expired.example.com/downloads/install.sh\n</pre>\n<h4>Compliant solution</h4>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"1\" data-diff-type=\"compliant\">\nname: Example\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n\njobs:\n  main:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: example\n        run: curl -O https://new.example.com/downloads/install.sh\n</pre>\n<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"2\" data-diff-type=\"noncompliant\">\nname: Example\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n\njobs:\n  main:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: example\n        # Sensitive\n        run: wget --no-check-certificate https://expired.example.com/downloads/install.sh\n</pre>\n<h4>Compliant solution</h4>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"2\" data-diff-type=\"compliant\">\nname: Example\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n\njobs:\n  main:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: example\n        run: wget https://new.example.com/downloads/install.sh\n</pre>\n<h3>How does this work?</h3>\n<p>Addressing the vulnerability of disabled TLS certificate validation primarily involves re-enabling the default validation.</p>\n<p>To avoid running into problems with invalid certificates, consider the following sections.</p>\n<h4>Using trusted certificates</h4>\n<p>If possible, always use a certificate issued by a well-known, trusted CA for your server. Most programming environments come with a predefined list\nof trusted root CAs, and certificates issued by these authorities are validated automatically. This is the best practice, and it requires no\nadditional code or configuration.</p>\n<h4>Working with self-signed certificates or non-standard CAs</h4>\n<p>In some cases, you might need to work with a server using a self-signed certificate, or a certificate issued by a CA not included in your trusted\nroots. Rather than disabling certificate validation in your code, you can add the necessary certificates to your trust store.</p>\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n<h3>Standards</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li> OWASP - <a href=\"https://owasp.org/Top10/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures/\">Top 10 2021 Category A2 - Cryptographic Failures</a> </li>\n  <li> OWASP - <a href=\"https://owasp.org/Top10/A05_2021-Security_Misconfiguration/\">Top 10 2021 Category A5 - Security Misconfiguration</a> </li>\n  <li> OWASP - <a href=\"https://owasp.org/Top10/A07_2021-Identification_and_Authentication_Failures/\">Top 10 2021 Category A7 - Identification and\n  Authentication Failures</a> </li>\n  <li> OWASP - <a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A3_2017-Sensitive_Data_Exposure\">Top 10 2017 Category A3 - Sensitive Data\n  Exposure</a> </li>\n  <li> OWASP - <a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A6_2017-Security_Misconfiguration\">Top 10 2017 Category A6 - Security\n  Misconfiguration</a> </li>\n  <li> CWE - <a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/295\">CWE-295 - Improper Certificate Validation</a> </li>\n  <li> STIG Viewer - <a href=\"https://stigviewer.com/stigs/application_security_and_development/2024-12-06/finding/V-222550\">Application Security and\n  Development: V-222550</a> - The application must validate certificates by constructing a certification path to an accepted trust anchor. </li>\n</ul>",

When you disable certificate validation, you are removing a key mechanism designed to\nbuild this trust in internet communication, opening your system up to a number of potential threats.</p>\n<h4>Identity spoofing</h4>\n<p>If a system does not validate certificates, it cannot confirm the identity of the other party involved in the communication. An attacker can\nexploit this by creating a fake server and masquerading as a legitimate one. For example, they might set up a server that looks like your bank’s\nserver, tricking your system into thinking it is communicating with the bank. This scenario, called identity spoofing, allows the attacker to collect\nany data your system sends to them, potentially leading to significant data breaches.</p>\n<h4>Loss of data integrity</h4>\n<p>When TLS certificate validation is disabled, the integrity of the data you send and receive cannot be guaranteed. An attacker could modify the data\nin transit, and you would have no way of knowing. This could range from subtle manipulations of the data you receive to the injection of malicious\ncode or malware into your system. The consequences of such breaches of data integrity can be severe, depending on the nature of the data and the\nsystem.</p>\n<h2>How to fix it</h2>\n<h3>Code examples</h3>\n<p>The following code contains examples of disabled certificate validation.</p>\n<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"1\" data-diff-type=\"noncompliant\">\nname: Example\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n\njobs:\n  main:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: example\n        # Sensitive\n        run: curl --insecure -O https://expired.example.com/downloads/install.sh\n</pre>\n<h4>Compliant solution</h4>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"1\" data-diff-type=\"compliant\">\nname: Example\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n\njobs:\n  main:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: example\n        run: curl -O https://new.example.com/downloads/install.sh\n</pre>\n<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"2\" data-diff-type=\"noncompliant\">\nname: Example\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n\njobs:\n  main:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: example\n        # Sensitive\n        run: wget --no-check-certificate https://expired.example.com/downloads/install.sh\n</pre>\n<h4>Compliant solution</h4>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"2\" data-diff-type=\"compliant\">\nname: Example\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n\njobs:\n  main:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n      - name: example\n        run: wget https://new.example.com/downloads/install.sh\n</pre>\n<h3>How does this work?</h3>\n<p>Addressing the vulnerability of disabled TLS certificate validation primarily involves re-enabling the default validation.</p>\n<p>To avoid running into problems with invalid certificates, consider the following sections.</p>\n<h4>Using trusted certificates</h4>\n<p>If possible, always use a certificate issued by a well-known, trusted CA for your server. Most programming environments come with a predefined list\nof trusted root CAs, and certificates issued by these authorities are validated automatically. This is the best practice, and it requires no\nadditional code or configuration.</p>\n<h4>Working with self-signed certificates or non-standard CAs</h4>\n<p>In some cases, you might need to work with a server using a self-signed certificate, or a certificate issued by a CA not included in your trusted\nroots. Rather than disabling certificate validation in your code, you can add the necessary certificates to your trust store.</p>\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n<h3>Standards</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li> OWASP - <a href=\"https://owasp.org/Top10/A02_2021-Cryptographic_Failures/\">Top 10 2021 Category A2 - Cryptographic Failures</a> </li>\n  <li> OWASP - <a href=\"https://owasp.org/Top10/A05_2021-Security_Misconfiguration/\">Top 10 2021 Category A5 - Security Misconfiguration</a> </li>\n  <li> OWASP - <a href=\"https://owasp.org/Top10/A07_2021-Identification_and_Authentication_Failures/\">Top 10 2021 Category A7 - Identification and\n  Authentication Failures</a> </li>\n  <li> OWASP - <a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A3_2017-Sensitive_Data_Exposure\">Top 10 2017 Category A3 - Sensitive Data\n  Exposure</a> </li>\n  <li> OWASP - <a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A6_2017-Security_Misconfiguration\">Top 10 2017 Category A6 - Security\n  Misconfiguration</a> </li>\n  <li> CWE - <a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/295\">CWE-295 - Improper Certificate Validation</a> </li>\n  <li> STIG Viewer - <a href=\"https://stigviewer.com/stigs/application_security_and_development/2024-12-06/finding/V-222550\">Application Security and\n  Development: V-222550</a> - The application must validate certificates by constructing a certification path to an accepted trust anchor. </li>\n</ul>",

It means that an attacker able to sniff traffic from the network can read, modify, or corrupt the\ntransported content.

Instead, use environment\nvariables to safely pass untrusted data without risk of code execution.</p>\n<p>The recommended approach is to assign untrusted data to environment variables using the <code>env</code> key, then reference these variables using\nstandard shell variable syntax (<code>$VARIABLE_NAME</code> or <code>${VARIABLE_NAME}</code>) rather than GitHub’s expression syntax (<code>${{ …​\n}}</code>).</p>\n<h3>Code examples</h3>\n<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>\n<p>The following GitHub Action is vulnerable to command injections as it uses untrusted input directly in a run command:</p>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"1\" data-diff-type=\"noncompliant\">\nname: Example\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n    branches: [ main ]\n\njobs:\n  main:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n      - name: Example Step\n        run: |\n          pr_title=\"${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}\" # Noncompliant: expansion happens before shell execution\n          echo \"PR title: $pr_title\"\n</pre>\n<p>If an attacker creates a pull request with a title containing <code>\"; rm -rf / #</code>, the expression expansion will transform the assignment\ninto <code>pr_title=\"\"; rm -rf / #\"</code>, which the shell will execute as multiple commands, not just an assignment.</p>\n<p>Workflow inputs of type <code>string</code> (which is the default type) are also vulnerable when expanded directly in shell commands:</p>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"2\" data-diff-type=\"noncompliant\">\nname: Example\n\non:\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      package_name:\n        description: 'Package name to install'\n        required: true\n        type: string\n\njobs:\n  main:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n      - name: Install package\n        run: |\n          apt-get install ${{ inputs.package_name }} # Noncompliant: string input expanded directly\n</pre>\n<h4>Compliant solution</h4>\n<p>Use environment variables to safely pass untrusted data:</p>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"1\" data-diff-type=\"compliant\">\nname: Example\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n    branches: [ main ]\n\njobs:\n  main:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n      - name: Example Step\n        env:\n          PR_TITLE: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}\n        run: |\n          echo \"PR title: $PR_TITLE\"\n</pre>\n<p>To securely use workflow inputs, assign them to environment variables just like any other untrusted data. Alternatively, change the input type from\n<code>string</code> to <code>choice</code> with predefined options. This restricts user input to safe values controlled by the workflow author:</p>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"2\" data-diff-type=\"compliant\">\nname: Example\n\non:\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      package_name:\n        description: 'Package name to install'\n        required: true\n        type: choice\n        options:\n          - nginx\n          - apache2\n          - postgresql\n\njobs:\n  main:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n      - name: Install package\n        run: |\n          apt-get install ${{ inputs.package_name }}\n</pre>\n<h3>How does this work?</h3>\n<p>The key difference lies in when and how the untrusted data is processed:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> <strong>Direct interpolation (vulnerable)</strong>: When using <code>${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}</code> directly in a shell command,\n  GitHub Actions processes the workflow file and expands the expression <strong>before</strong> the shell script runs. The expansion happens at the\n  workflow processing stage:\n    <ol>\n      <li> GitHub Actions reads the workflow YAML file </li>\n      <li> It evaluates <code>${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}</code> and replaces it with the actual PR title value </li>\n      <li> The resulting string (which may contain shell metacharacters) is inserted into the script </li>\n      <li> The shell then receives and executes the already-expanded script </li>\n    </ol>  </li>\n  <li> <strong>Environment variable approach (safe)</strong>: When the untrusted data is assigned to an environment variable using the\n  <code>env</code> key, GitHub Actions still expands the expression, but the expansion happens in a different context:\n    <ol>\n      <li> GitHub Actions expands <code>${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}</code> and assigns the value to an environment variable </li>\n      <li> The shell script references this variable using standard shell syntax (<code>$PR_TITLE</code>) </li>\n      <li> The shell treats the environment variable’s contents as literal data, not as executable code </li>\n    </ol>  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>When the shell evaluates <code>$PR_TITLE</code>, it performs variable expansion (not expression expansion), which treats the value as a string\nliteral. Even if the value contains shell metacharacters, they remain as literal characters and are not interpreted as commands. This separation\nensures that malicious shell syntax in the untrusted data cannot be interpreted as commands, effectively neutralizing injection attempts.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> <strong>Choice input type (safe when used directly)</strong>: Unlike <code>string</code> inputs, <code>choice</code> inputs restrict user input\n  to a predefined list of options that are controlled by the workflow author. When a <code>choice</code> input is used directly in a GitHub expression\n  within a <code>run</code> block, it is safe because:\n    <ol>\n      <li> The workflow author defines all possible values in the <code>options</code> list </li>\n      <li> Attackers cannot provide arbitrary values, since they are only allowed to select from the predefined options </li>\n      <li> Since the workflow author controls the options, they can ensure none contain shell metacharacters or malicious content </li>\n      <li> The expression expansion will only ever produce one of the predefined, safe values </li>\n    </ol>  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Pitfalls</h3>\n<h4>Fixing vulnerabilities only in the main branch</h4>\n<p>It is important to note that fixing this vulnerability requires updating the workflow files in all existing branches of the repository. GitHub\nActions workflows can be triggered from any branch, and an attacker could potentially target vulnerable workflows in older or feature branches. A\ncomprehensive fix should include updating all branches that contain the vulnerable workflow patterns.</p>\n<h4>Accessing environment variables through GitHub expressions</h4>\n<p>While storing untrusted data in environment variables is the correct approach, it is important to reference them properly. Simply putting the data\nin an environment variable but then accessing it through GitHub’s expression syntax (<code>${{ env.VARIABLE_NAME }}</code>) will still result in\ncommand injection vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>The following example demonstrates this common mistake:</p>\n<pre>\nname: Example\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n    branches: [ main ]\n\njobs:\n  main:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n      - name: Example\n        env:\n          PR_TITLE: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}\n        run: |\n          echo \"PR title: ${{ env.PR_TITLE }}\" # Noncompliant\n</pre>\n<h3>Going the extra mile</h3>\n<h4>Security hardening</h4>\n<p>Beyond fixing the immediate security issue, consider implementing additional security measures:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> <strong>Minimal permissions</strong>: Configure workflows to use the minimum necessary permissions by explicitly setting\n  <code>permissions</code> for the <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> and avoiding overly broad access. </li>\n  <li> <strong>Branch protection</strong>: Implement branch protection rules that require code review for changes to workflow files, preventing\n  unauthorized modifications. </li>\n  <li> <strong>External contributor restrictions</strong>: Configure workflows to require approval for runs triggered by external contributors,\n  reducing the risk of malicious workflow executions. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Advanced input validation</h4>\n<p>For enhanced security, implement comprehensive input validation:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> <strong>Allowlists</strong>: Instead of just avoiding dangerous characters, use allowlists to only accept inputs that match expected patterns\n  (e.g., valid branch names, semantic version formats). </li>\n  <li> <strong>Custom validation actions</strong>: Create reusable composite actions that encapsulate input validation logic, making it easier to\n  apply consistent security controls across workflows. </li>\n  <li> <strong>Input sanitization</strong>: When possible, sanitize inputs by removing or escaping potentially dangerous characters before processing\n  them. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n<h3>Documentation</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li> GitHub Docs - <a\n  href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#understanding-the-risk-of-script-injections\">Understanding the risk of script injections</a> </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Standards</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li> OWASP - <a href=\"https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/\">Top 10 2021 Category A3 - Injection</a> </li>\n  <li> OWASP - <a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A1_2017-Injection\">Top 10 2017 Category A1 - Injection</a> </li>\n  <li> CWE - <a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20\">CWE-20 - Improper Input Validation</a> </li>\n  <li> CWE - <a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78\">CWE-78 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command</a> </li>\n  <li> STIG Viewer - <a href=\"https://stigviewer.com/stigs/application_security_and_development/2024-12-06/finding/V-222604\">Application Security and\n  Development: V-222604</a> - The application must protect from command injection. </li>\n  <li> STIG Viewer - <a href=\"https://stigviewer.com/stigs/application_security_and_development/2024-12-06/finding/V-222609\">Application Security and\n  Development: V-222609</a> - The application must not be subject to input handling vulnerabilities. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Related rules</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li> <a href='/organizations/ranganathantvb/rules?open=githubactions%3AS8263&rule_key=githubactions%3AS8263'>S8263</a> GitHub Action invocations should not be vulnerable to parameter injection attacks </li>\n</ul>",

This restricts user input to safe values controlled by the workflow author:</p>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"2\" data-diff-type=\"compliant\">\nname: Example\n\non:\n  workflow_dispatch:\n    inputs:\n      package_name:\n        description: 'Package name to install'\n        required: true\n        type: choice\n        options:\n          - nginx\n          - apache2\n          - postgresql\n\njobs:\n  main:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n      - name: Install package\n        run: |\n          apt-get install ${{ inputs.package_name }}\n</pre>\n<h3>How does this work?</h3>\n<p>The key difference lies in when and how the untrusted data is processed:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> <strong>Direct interpolation (vulnerable)</strong>: When using <code>${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}</code> directly in a shell command,\n  GitHub Actions processes the workflow file and expands the expression <strong>before</strong> the shell script runs. The expansion happens at the\n  workflow processing stage:\n    <ol>\n      <li> GitHub Actions reads the workflow YAML file </li>\n      <li> It evaluates <code>${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}</code> and replaces it with the actual PR title value </li>\n      <li> The resulting string (which may contain shell metacharacters) is inserted into the script </li>\n      <li> The shell then receives and executes the already-expanded script </li>\n    </ol>  </li>\n  <li> <strong>Environment variable approach (safe)</strong>: When the untrusted data is assigned to an environment variable using the\n  <code>env</code> key, GitHub Actions still expands the expression, but the expansion happens in a different context:\n    <ol>\n      <li> GitHub Actions expands <code>${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}</code> and assigns the value to an environment variable </li>\n      <li> The shell script references this variable using standard shell syntax (<code>$PR_TITLE</code>) </li>\n      <li> The shell treats the environment variable’s contents as literal data, not as executable code </li>\n    </ol>  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>When the shell evaluates <code>$PR_TITLE</code>, it performs variable expansion (not expression expansion), which treats the value as a string\nliteral. Even if the value contains shell metacharacters, they remain as literal characters and are not interpreted as commands. This separation\nensures that malicious shell syntax in the untrusted data cannot be interpreted as commands, effectively neutralizing injection attempts.</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> <strong>Choice input type (safe when used directly)</strong>: Unlike <code>string</code> inputs, <code>choice</code> inputs restrict user input\n  to a predefined list of options that are controlled by the workflow author. When a <code>choice</code> input is used directly in a GitHub expression\n  within a <code>run</code> block, it is safe because:\n    <ol>\n      <li> The workflow author defines all possible values in the <code>options</code> list </li>\n      <li> Attackers cannot provide arbitrary values, since they are only allowed to select from the predefined options </li>\n      <li> Since the workflow author controls the options, they can ensure none contain shell metacharacters or malicious content </li>\n      <li> The expression expansion will only ever produce one of the predefined, safe values </li>\n    </ol>  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Pitfalls</h3>\n<h4>Fixing vulnerabilities only in the main branch</h4>\n<p>It is important to note that fixing this vulnerability requires updating the workflow files in all existing branches of the repository. GitHub\nActions workflows can be triggered from any branch, and an attacker could potentially target vulnerable workflows in older or feature branches. A\ncomprehensive fix should include updating all branches that contain the vulnerable workflow patterns.</p>\n<h4>Accessing environment variables through GitHub expressions</h4>\n<p>While storing untrusted data in environment variables is the correct approach, it is important to reference them properly. Simply putting the data\nin an environment variable but then accessing it through GitHub’s expression syntax (<code>${{ env.VARIABLE_NAME }}</code>) will still result in\ncommand injection vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>The following example demonstrates this common mistake:</p>\n<pre>\nname: Example\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n    branches: [ main ]\n\njobs:\n  main:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n      - name: Example\n        env:\n          PR_TITLE: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}\n        run: |\n          echo \"PR title: ${{ env.PR_TITLE }}\" # Noncompliant\n</pre>\n<h3>Going the extra mile</h3>\n<h4>Security hardening</h4>\n<p>Beyond fixing the immediate security issue, consider implementing additional security measures:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> <strong>Minimal permissions</strong>: Configure workflows to use the minimum necessary permissions by explicitly setting\n  <code>permissions</code> for the <code>GITHUB_TOKEN</code> and avoiding overly broad access. </li>\n  <li> <strong>Branch protection</strong>: Implement branch protection rules that require code review for changes to workflow files, preventing\n  unauthorized modifications. </li>\n  <li> <strong>External contributor restrictions</strong>: Configure workflows to require approval for runs triggered by external contributors,\n  reducing the risk of malicious workflow executions. </li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Advanced input validation</h4>\n<p>For enhanced security, implement comprehensive input validation:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> <strong>Allowlists</strong>: Instead of just avoiding dangerous characters, use allowlists to only accept inputs that match expected patterns\n  (e.g., valid branch names, semantic version formats). </li>\n  <li> <strong>Custom validation actions</strong>: Create reusable composite actions that encapsulate input validation logic, making it easier to\n  apply consistent security controls across workflows. </li>\n  <li> <strong>Input sanitization</strong>: When possible, sanitize inputs by removing or escaping potentially dangerous characters before processing\n  them. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Resources</h2>\n<h3>Documentation</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li> GitHub Docs - <a\n  href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#understanding-the-risk-of-script-injections\">Understanding the risk of script injections</a> </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Standards</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li> OWASP - <a href=\"https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/\">Top 10 2021 Category A3 - Injection</a> </li>\n  <li> OWASP - <a href=\"https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A1_2017-Injection\">Top 10 2017 Category A1 - Injection</a> </li>\n  <li> CWE - <a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/20\">CWE-20 - Improper Input Validation</a> </li>\n  <li> CWE - <a href=\"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78\">CWE-78 - Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command</a> </li>\n  <li> STIG Viewer - <a href=\"https://stigviewer.com/stigs/application_security_and_development/2024-12-06/finding/V-222604\">Application Security and\n  Development: V-222604</a> - The application must protect from command injection. </li>\n  <li> STIG Viewer - <a href=\"https://stigviewer.com/stigs/application_security_and_development/2024-12-06/finding/V-222609\">Application Security and\n  Development: V-222609</a> - The application must not be subject to input handling vulnerabilities. </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Related rules</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li> {rule:githubactions:S8263} GitHub Action invocations should not be vulnerable to parameter injection attacks </li>\n</ul>",

A reader can first explore a\n  high-level view of what the code is performing then go deeper and deeper by looking at called functions content.<br> <em>Note:</em> This does not\n  apply to recursive calls, those will increment cognitive score. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The method of computation is fully detailed in the pdf linked in the resources.</p>\n<h3>What is the potential impact?</h3>\n<p>Developers spend more time reading and understanding code than writing it.

It does not apply to the use of plain\n<code>char</code>.</p>\n<h3>Rationale</h3>\n<p>It is <em>implementation-defined</em> how much storage is required for any object of the <em>standard signed integer types</em> or <em>standard\nunsigned integer types</em>. When the amount of storage being used is important, the use of types having specified widths makes it clear how much\nstorage is being reserved for each object.</p>\n<p>The C++ Standard Library <em>header file</em> [1] <code>&lt;cstdint&gt;</code> often provides a suitable set of integer types having specified\nwidths. If a project defines its own type aliases, it is good practice to use <code>static_assert</code> to validate any size assumptions.

      "htmlDesc": "<p>This rule raises an issue when the code cognitive complexity of a function is above a certain threshold.</p>\n<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>\n<p>Cognitive Complexity is a measure of how hard it is to understand the control flow of a unit of code.

      "htmlDesc": "<p>Code should not rely on features beyond the configured C++ standard</p>\n<h2>Why is this an issue?</h2>\n<p>Relying on features that are not part of the configured C++ standard leads to non-portable builds and fragile code. Some toolchains accept such\ncode as extensions or for backward compatibility, while others strictly reject it under the same standard setting. This rule flags:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li> Uses of features from future C++ standards (compared to the configured standard). </li>\n  <li> Uses of features removed in the configured C++ standard. </li>\n  <li> Uses of C-only constructs that some C++ implementations accept as extensions. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Keeping code within the configured standard ensures consistency across compilers and prevents accidental lock-in to permissive extensions. Check\nthe list of related rules for focused rules that report specific compiler extension cases; <a href='/organizations/ranganathantvb/rules?open=cpp%3AS8216&rule_key=cpp%3AS8216'>S8216</a> covers remaining standard violations not\naddressed by these specialized rules.</p>\n<p>This version primarily reports extensions starting from C++20 and later. For example, it does not yet report use of a C++17-only feature when the\nconfigured standard is C++14. This limitation is temporary and will be addressed in a future update.</p>\n<h2>How to fix it</h2>\n<p>Replace uses of out-of-scope features with standard-conforming alternatives that exist in the configured C++ standard. If the newer feature (or a\nremoved feature) is truly required, upgrade (or align) the project’s configured standard and all toolchains consistently.</p>\n<h3>Defaulted comparison operators</h3>\n<p>Defaulted comparison operators are introduced in C++20. When the configured standard is earlier than C++20, using defaulted comparison operators is\nnoncompliant. Under C++20 or later, the same code is compliant.</p>\n<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"1\" data-diff-type=\"noncompliant\">\nstruct Account {\n  int id;\n  bool operator==(const Account&amp;) const = default; // Noncompliant before C++20\n};\n</pre>\n<h4>Compliant solution</h4>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"1\" data-diff-type=\"compliant\">\nstruct Account {\n  int id;\n  bool operator==(const Account&amp; other) const { return id == other.id; }\n};\n</pre>\n<h3>Using enum declaration</h3>\n<p>The \"using enum\" declaration is a C++20 feature. When the configured standard is earlier than C++20, it is noncompliant to rely on it. Under C++20\nor later, the same code is compliant.</p>\n<h4>Noncompliant code example</h4>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"2\" data-diff-type=\"noncompliant\">\nenum class Status { Ok, Error };\nusing enum Status; // Noncompliant before C++20\nauto s = Ok;\n</pre>\n<h4>Compliant solution</h4>\n<pre data-diff-id=\"2\" data-diff-type=\"compliant\">\nenum class Status { Ok, Error };\nauto s = Status::Ok;\n</pre>\n<h3>Lambda template parameter list</h3>\n<p>Lambda template parameter lists are available starting in C++20.

However, for the purposes of this rule, a violation occurs whenever a memory\nlocation that does not contain a live object of an appropriate type is accessed.</p>\n<h3>Rationale</h3>\n<p>It is <em>undefined behaviour</em> to access an object before it has been initialized or after its lifetime has ended (even if the memory occupied\nby the object has not been released).</p>\n<p>It is possible to refer to an object before its lifetime has begun, for example, by referring to a non-active member of a union.</p>\n<p>Compliance with the rules cross-referenced by this rule helps to prevent lifetime violations.</p>\n<h3>Example</h3>\n<pre>\nstruct X\n{\n  void doSomething() {}\n};\n\nvoid h( X * px )\n{\n  px-&gt;~X();                           // End the lifetime of *px\n  px-&gt;doSomething();                  // Non-compliant\n}\n\nvoid g()\n{\n  X a{};\n  auto &amp; b = ( X{} = a );             // Immediate dangling of b\n  b.doSomething();                    // Non-compliant\n}\n\nvoid f()\n{\n  int32_t * pi = new int32_t { 42 };\n\n  delete pi;\n  std::cout &lt;&lt; *pi;                   // Non-compliant\n}\n\nunion u\n{\n  int32_t  a;\n  uint16_t b[ 2 ];\n};\n\nuint16_t u2()\n{\n  u o;\n\n  o.a = 42;\n  return o.b[ 0 ];                    // Non-compliant - b is not the active member\n}\n</pre>\n<p>See the cross-referenced rules for further examples.</p>\n<p><strong>Copyright The MISRA Consortium Limited © 2023</strong></p>"
