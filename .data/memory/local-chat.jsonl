{"role": "assistant", "content": "Based on the provided context, it seems like you want to scan issues from your GitHub repository and summarize risks based on SonarQube analysis results. Here is a general plan for this task:\n\n1. **Fetching Repository Issues**: Use the GitHub API to fetch all open issues in the specified repository. You can do this by sending a GET request to `https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues`, where `{owner}` and `{repo}` are placeholders for your username and repository name respectively.\n\n2. **Parsing Issues**: Analyze the issues returned by GitHub API to identify potential risks. This could involve looking at issue titles or descriptions, assignees, etc. You might want to create a list of known risk patterns that you can look for in these fields.\n\n3. **Fetching SonarQube Analysis Results**: Use the SonarQube API to fetch analysis results for your repository. This could involve sending a GET request to `http://sonarqube_server/api/issues/search?componentKeys={repo_key}`, where `{repo_key}` is the key of your repository in SonarQube (which should match the name you used when setting up SonarQube).\n\n4. **Parsing SonarQube Analysis Results**: Analyze the issues returned by SonarQube API to identify potential risks. This could involve looking at issue severity, component names, etc. You might want to create a list of known risk patterns that you can look for in these fields.\n\n5. **Summarizing Risks**: Create a summary of the identified risks. This could be as simple as listing them out or more complex, like categorizing them by severity and assigning counts to each category.\n\n6. **Report Generation**: Finally, generate a report based on your summarized risks. You can use any reporting tool you prefer for this step.\n\nRemember that the above steps are just a general guideline and might need adjustments depending on specific requirements of your project. Also, ensure to handle API rate limits properly as per GitHub's REST API v3 guidelines.\n"}
