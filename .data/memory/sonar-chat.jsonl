{"role": "assistant", "content": "The Sonar findings indicate that your system is using outdated TLS protocols, which are considered weak and insecure by the cryptography community. Here's how you can remediate this issue:\n\n1. **Upgrade to TLS v1.2**: This is still considered good and secure practice by the cryptography community. The use of TLS v1.2 ensures compatibility with a wide range of platforms and enables seamless communication between different systems that do not yet have TLS v1.3 support.\n\n2. **Review your codebase for outdated or insecure cipher suites**: Its TLS v1.2 settings may enable older and insecure cipher suites that are deprecated as insecure. You should review the configuration of any frameworks, libraries, or tools you're using to ensure they support TLS 1.2 and aren't using outdated or insecure cipher suites.\n\n3. **Consider upgrading your system**: If possible, consider upgrading to a newer version of your software that supports TLS v1.2 or later. This could mean updating the operating system, libraries, or tools you're using, or possibly switching to a different programming language or framework that has better support for modern cryptography standards.\n\n4. **Implement security best practices**: Regularly update your systems and applications to use the latest security patches and updates. This includes both software updates and patch management. \n\n5. **Educate your team**: Make sure everyone on your team is aware of these security issues, how they can be exploited, and what steps they should take to mitigate their risk.\n\nRemember that while TLS v1.2 is secure, it's not the only option available today. As new vulnerabilities are discovered and older cipher suites become insecure, you may need to upgrade your systems to use newer versions of TLS or other cryptographic standards. \n\nAlso note that these steps should be implemented by a security team member who is familiar with secure coding practices and the specific technologies being used.\n"}
